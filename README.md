I created a small Python file that recognizes voice commands. In the makeTask function, you can add commands to which it will respond, as well as functions that it will perform, it is not necessary to open the site, only an example is provided here. If you want to make your own voice assistant, this file can be your starting point ;)

It's easy to talk to it, run the file, after he synthesizes a voice message that everything is fine and the inscription "Say" lights up in the console, you can speak. Say the word "Bro" which is the trigger, then say the task, for example "open web", as you will see, it will open the google page (don't forget to change the path to your browser in the code)
